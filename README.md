# TODO list

You will create a TDOD list app that will display things you need to do :)

### Run the app using `yarn` then `yarn start`

## Requirements

1. Create a component named `TodoItem` that will display the TODO data and the following UI.
   1. A checkbox that represent the complete state of the item.
   2. A Paragraph that display the text of the task.
2. In `App.js` map throught the data in the `TodoData.js` file.
   1. The Complete key should define the checkbox state.
   2. The text key should represent the todo task text.
   3. The id will be needed when looping for the key value that react will complain about.
3. Make the todoData a `state` and whenever the checkbox is clicked update the state to reflect that.

PS: Style the App however you like.
